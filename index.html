    <p>A well organized, articulate individual with a strong innovative approach to task completion.</p>
    <p>I am quick to adapt and learn new skills, which help drive and improve my technical capabilities.</p>
    <p>My intentions for the near future are to work towards applying my spectrum of skills to build a successful career.</p>
    <p>I have motivation to learn new skills and acquire qualifications in other sectors.</p>
    <p>I am very ambitious and wish to further my knowledge in a professional working environment.</p>
    <h3 id="Ikemefuna">ALTSCH TRAINING</h3>
    <P>On the training thus far, I've been able to learn quite alot within a short period of time.</P>
    <p>I've learnt how to create HTML documents, create forms, use git & github to push codes.</p>
    <p>I'm currently on how to use CSS to define the appearances of the content I create with HTML.</p>
    <p>Though I've had challenges on creating my link on github which was solved by my tutors.</p>
    <p>However, i believe with subsequent training, I will improve alot.</p>
